send command by LIN bus to make all led on

this is written by CYPRESS PSOC CREATOR 3.0, this software is to send command to light all led on by, it simulator LIN bus protocal and send command.
this software is for testing car ECU, because often intrepidcs fire is used to test ECU,but it is expensive, and difficult to get it for test ECU, so i write this software to simlulate LIN command. 
this software is downloaded into CYPRESS DEVELOPMENT BOARD CY8CKIT-042, then connect LIN of ECU to TX port in board. CY8CKIT-042 work as LIN master manchine, and ECU work as LIN slave machine.
that is all.
